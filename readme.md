#Plastic-Model-Deployment

## Problem Statement
  Develop a reliable and efficient AI-based object detection model using drone images to detect plastic waste in rivers and demonstrate a feasible solution/system architecture for implementation, ultimately reducing the negative impact of plastic pollution on the environment and human health.
 

## Objective


This project aims to:

- detect plastic waste in rivers and help in reducing water pollution
- to give the location of river and alsom the distance from the user's currnt location where plastic is present and also latitude and longitude of plastic

## Proposed Solution

This project covers all aspects that need to be emphasised on to minimise the problem:
- plastic is detected
- location of river is given
- latitude and longitude of plastic is given
-distance between plastic and the device/concerned authorities is given
